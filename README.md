# BlockList Aggregator

Inspired from https://gist.github.com/glaszig/bf96beccf4694ae25d4f1f7cc6224985 from [glaszig](https://github.com/glaszig).

The script downloads all the public lists from [I-BlockList](https://www.iblocklist.com/lists) into a super list.

## Release

Every day the script is executed by Github Actions and updates the `nightly` tag.

You can download the file directly here:
